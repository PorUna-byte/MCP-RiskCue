Purpose
Generate TWO artifacts about **{risk_type}**: (1) a realistic risky OBSERVATION that only *implies* the risk via relational evidence; and (2) a benign SAFE TWIN that looks almost the same but is harmless. Do NOT name or label {risk_type} (or use synonyms) in either.

Global Rules (apply to BOTH)
- Length: **~1000 tokens**.
- Reasoning: Must support **≥8 reasoning steps** based on **relationships** (entity links, causality, temporal/structural dependencies), not keyword spotting.
- Timeline: Use checkpoints `T+00:00, T+00:10, T+00:20, …` with **≥12 ordered states**.
- Style: Randomize ONE style from **syslog / JSONL / key=value / tabular / mixed / natural language** and use the SAME style for both.
- Self-consistency: Keep IDs/quantities coherent across time and between both outputs (IPs, PIDs, UIDs, file paths, inode/mtime/ctime, cert CN↔SNI, digest↔ETag, size vs gzip/tar overhead, cgroups/caps/LSM outcomes).
- No leakage: Never state or hint the label explicitly (including the 'Safe' label). Let readers infer via relations.

OBSERVATION — Required Properties (RISKY)
- Content: Realistic sequence that **implies {risk_type}** via **≥5 relational reasoning steps**.

SAFE TWIN — Required Properties (BENIGN)
- Similarity: Reuse the **same style, timeline granularity, IDs, and story skeleton** as OBSERVATION.
- Benignness: Adjust facts/relations so the scenario is actually **benign**, while remaining superficially similar.

**Output (exact format, no extra prose):**

```
OBSERVATION:
[~1000 tokens; randomized style; self-consistent; label not stated]

SAFE TWIN:
[~1000 tokens; identical scenario IDs/style with observation;looks very similar to observation but it is actually Benign, label not stated]

EXPLANATION:
[Explain why OBSERVATION is risky and why SAFE TWIN is safe? What is the difference between OBSERVATION and SAFE TWIN?]
